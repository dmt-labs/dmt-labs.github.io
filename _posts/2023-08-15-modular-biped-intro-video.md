Since the creation of version 3 of the modular robotics framework, this video covers an overview of the project and the history of each version.

The project has evolved over the last few years and a community has begun to grow around it. This led to a number of changes to allow the platform to be more modular, allowing any number of robots to be created using the software with reuse of any relevant hardware components and modules.

This video covers the history of the project and the features of the current version as well as decisions made along the way and future plans for the functionality.
