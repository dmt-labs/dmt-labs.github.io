## Featured on Official Raspberry Pi News

I was very excited to see that the Modular Biped project was featured on the official Raspberry Pi news page. This is a great honour and I'm very grateful to the Raspberry Pi team for the recognition. The article focussed on the background of the project and the history of the development.

The project has been chosen among other finalists such as a conveyor belt monitoring system, a guitar playing robot and even another companion robot!

All the projects are very impressive and worth reading about, take a look at the article below.

## Launch of the Maker Forge website

After looking for a way to share my projects and ideas, a conversation with Kevin Mcaleer prompted me to create a website to host my projects and blog posts. I wanted to create a place where I could document my progress and learning as well as share guides and news from the wider maker community.

## Raspberry Pi 5 Announced

The Raspberry Pi 5 was announced on the 28th September 2023. This is a very exciting announcement as it brings a number of improvements over the previous model, including support for dual CSI cameras which may be beneficial for 3D imaging and localisation.

I'm looking forward to the release of the new model and will be testing it with the Modular Biped project as soon as I can get my hands on one.
