Disney Research has announced a new robot at IROS2023 that looks suspiciously like the BD-1 robot from Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order.

[This post](https://twitter.com/davsca1/status/1709693137478648155?s=20) from David Scaramuzza from the University of Zurich shows the robot in action.

Disney's history of animatronic characters dates back to 1971, with the Hall of Presidents at Disney World, but making robots express emotions while moving convincingly has become increasingly challenging. To address this, Disney Research developed a new system leveraging reinforcement learning. The team, led by Moritz BÃ¤cher from Disney Research in Zurich, created the robot using 3D printing and modular hardware, allowing for rapid design iterations. It features a four-degree-of-freedom head and five-degree-of-freedom legs with dynamic balancing.

Disney's approach involves collaboration between animators and roboticists, combining artistic intent with technical expertise. The challenge lies in translating animations into real-world robot movements effectively. Disney Research's solution is a reinforcement learning-based pipeline that simulates and balances the animator's vision with robust robotic actions. This system significantly reduces the time required to develop a new robotic character from years to months.

Reinforcement learning also leads to highly robust motions, enabling the robot to adapt to real-world scenarios while maintaining its character.

The researchers emphasize that the key takeaway is not just the robot itself but the adaptable process. This platform is hardware-agnostic, allowing for the rapid development of new behaviors, even with different robot forms. Disney aims to explore physical robotic characters further in future.

It's great to see this kind of research being done in the field of robotics, and I'm excited to see what comes next.
