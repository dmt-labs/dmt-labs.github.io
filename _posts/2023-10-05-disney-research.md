Disney Research has announced a new robot at IROS2023 that looks suspiciously like the BD-1 robot from Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order.

[This post](https://twitter.com/davsca1/status/1709693137478648155?s=20) from David Scaramuzza from the University of Zurich shows the robot in action.

The movement is very organic, and the post explains that it has been trained in a simulator using reinforcement learning.

It's great to see this kind of research being done in the field of robotics, and I'm excited to see what comes next.
