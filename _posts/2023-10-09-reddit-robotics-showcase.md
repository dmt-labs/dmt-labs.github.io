Earlier in the year I was invited to speak about the Modular Robotics Framework on session 2 of the Reddit Robotics Showcase. This was a great opportunity to share the project with a wider audience and to talk about the history of the project and the future plans.

The playlist for the entire showcase is now available on YouTube and linked below. There were a lot of really interesting projects, so please feel free to watch the entire series.

The showcase includes:

- Session 1: Robot Arms
- Session 2: Social, Domestic and Hobbyist Robots
- Session 3: Autonomous Mobile Robots
- Session 4: Startups and Solutions

The keynote for session 2 was Eliot Horowitz, CEO and Founder of VIAM. Eliot is also the founder of MongoDB, a database platform used by many companies around the world and joined the live stream to talk about how VIAM is helping to make robotics more accessible.
