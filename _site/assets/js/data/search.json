    "content": "Featured on Official Raspberry Pi NewsI was very excited to see that the Modular Biped project was featured on the official Raspberry Pi news page. This is a great honour and I’m very grateful to the Raspberry Pi team for the recognition. The article focussed on the background of the project and the history of the development.You can read the article here: Build a bipedal companion robot - Raspberry Pi NewsFinalist in the 2023 RealVNC Raspberry Pi PrizeThe Modular Biped project was selected as one of six finalists in the 2023 RealVNC Raspberry Pi Prize.The project has been chosen among other finalists such as a conveyor belt monitoring system, a guitar playing robot and even another companion robot!All the projects are very impressive and worth reading about, take a look at the article below.RealVNC Raspberry Pi Prize finalists - RealVNC BlogA more detailed article about each finalist (including the Modular Biped project) will be posted over the coming weeks on the RealVNC blog.RealVNC BlogLaunch of the Maker Forge websiteAfter looking for a way to share my projects and ideas, a conversation with Kevin Mcaleer prompted me to create a website to host my projects and blog posts. I wanted to create a place where I could document my progress and learning as well as share guides and news from the wider maker community.If you’re reading this then it means you are here, so welcome! I hope you enjoy the content and find it useful. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to get in touch via the discussion group.Raspberry Pi 5 AnnouncedThe Raspberry Pi 5 was announced on the 28th September 2023. This is a very exciting announcement as it brings a number of improvements over the previous model, including support for dual CSI cameras which may be beneficial for 3D imaging and localisation.I’m looking forward to the release of the new model and will be testing it with the Modular Biped project as soon as I can get my hands on one.https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/introducing-raspberry-pi-5/"

    "content": "When I first started working on the modular biped project, I had a few features in mind. The way that the robot behaved would depend entirely on the sensors and actuators it had in it’s arsenal. For that reason (and because I enjoy trying new things!) I decided to add as many as reasonably possible, as long as they were relevant to the brief of a ‘desktop companion robot’.Sensing the worldTo make the robot aware of it’s surroundings, I added a number of sensors. These include:Microwave sensor (RCWL-0516)This sensor has a digital output (true or false) and detects the presence of a human or animal within a few meters, even through walls. The sensor cannot be adjusted in sensitivity and so it was not useful to determine if a person was ‘in front’ of the robot, or even in the same room, but as a general ‘someone is near by’ detector it works well.Because the plan was to allow the robot to run autonomously and 24 hours a day, a sensor that detects people allows the robot to enter a power saving mode when no one is around. This is useful for a number of reasons, but primarily to reduce the power consumption and to reduce the wear on the servos.It is also a useful sensor for games and interactions, as it can detect if everyone is moving or still.It refreshes at a rate of once per second, which is sufficient for these purposes.Raspberry Pi Camera Module (wide angle lens)The camera is the main sensor for the robot. It has a versatile range of uses, including:  Face detection. When object detection detects a person, the mode switches to face detection so that the robot can focus on the face of the individual. The neck servos facilitate face tracking. If there is more than one face visible the robot will focus on the closest (largest) one.  Face recognition. This can be trained by collecting faces that the handler can label by placing into a named folder, at which point the robot can re-train the model. Note that this is available in the OpenCV functionality of version 2.  Object detection and recognition. This is useful for detecting objects when there are no faces to interact with. The robot simulates boredom by identifying objects from a list of pre-trained and focusses on each one for a few seconds before moving on to the next.  Timelapse and other capture features. The robot can be set to take a photo every few seconds, or to record video when it detects movement. This is useful for security and monitoring purposes.The wide angle lense is useful for the robot as it allows it to see a wider area, but it does distort the image. This is not a problem for the purposes of the robot, but it is worth noting.Microphones (MEMS)Image credit: AdafruitThe robot has 2 MEMS microphones, one on each side of the head. These are used for speech recognition but could be expanded to include other features such as sound detection and localisation.Speech recognition has been implemented with an ‘always listening’ approach, but when the robot enters rest mode this is paused. There is also the option to use a wake word, but this is not currently implemented as the module ‘chirp’ was used and is no longer maintained by the third party.Read MoreGyroscope (MPU6050)Built into the body circuitry is an MPU6050 gyroscope. This is used to detect the orientation of the robot and to determine if it is level or not. This is useful as the animation of the legs can throw off the center of gravity and cause the robot to fall over. The gyroscope is used to detect this and to correct the balance automatically in a continual loop.Interacting with the worldLED (Neopixels)Neopixels are addressable RGB LEDs that can be controlled individually or as a group.They are used to provide feedback to the user and to indicate the status of the robot.For example, when the robot is idle the eye LED is red. When the microwave sensor detects motion the eye changes to blue, and finally when the camera detects a person the eye changes to green.SpeakerA recent edition is a speaker module that connects directly to the audio output of the Raspberry Pi 3b+. This allows the robot to play sounds and music, as well as to speak using text to speech (TTS). The speaker is used to provide feedback to the user and to indicate the status of the robot.Image credit: The Pi Hut  Note: The Raspberry Pi 5 does not have an audio jack, but the same i2s connection that is used for the speakers may be compatible with an i2s speaker amplifier module. This will need investigationBuzzerPrior to adding the speaker, the plan was to enable the robot to emote and communicate with a buzzer in the head PCB, connected to the Raspberry Pi. Not only could this play simple tunes but with the addition of a piece of code it could also speak.Braillespeak (text to speech as tones)A few years prior to starting this project I had a concept for a way of using simple tones to output text. The concept was simple: split a word into each character, then convert each character into the ‘braille’ equivalent. This is a 6 bit binary number, which can be converted into a pair of tones. The tones can then be played in sequence to output the word.The advantage of this is that it is simple to implement and requires no additional hardware. The disadvantage is that it is slow and difficult to understand, but could be learned and would also allow for machine-to-machine communication over simple audio.This was disabled in the latest versions in favour of the audio output, but is still implemented in the code and hardware.Servos (animation, follow a face)I will need to write an article on the plethora of animation features that I attempted over the years whilst building this project, everything from being able to train an animation by recording mouse and keyboard input, to inverse kinematics for balance. There was even a dance mode at once point.The servos are an accessible choice for the project as they are reasonably cheap, easy to control, and don’t need an additional driver board. They are also very versatile and can be used for a number of purposes.The leg servos are standard servos SG5010 and the neck servos are MG92B, metal geared mini servos.In previous versions the entire robot worked with MG92B servos, as other mini servos such as SG90 or MG90 were not strong enough to support the weight of the robot.Calculating the weight your servos can handleYou can calculate the weight that your servos can support by taking the stall torque (found in the servo datasheet) and measuring the distance the weight is from the pivot point (the leg length, as an example).Torque is measured in kg/cm and is the weight the servo can support at a 1cm distance from the pivot point, so if you have a 3.5kg/cm servo and the weight is 2cm from the pivot point, the maximum weight it can support is half that value (1.75kg).If the weight is 10cm from the pivot point, the maximum weight it can support is 10%, or 0.35kg.Behaviours and PersonalityUsing the above sensors as inputs and actuators to facilitate interaction, the robot can be programmed to behave in any number of ways.I made the decision early on to create a state manager as part of the behaviour logic, so that the robot exhibits different behaviours depending on the state it is in.State ManagerThe diagram above shows a simplified overview of the state manager. Triggered by the wake event, we change the state to resting, alert or sleeping depending on input from the various sensors.The states determine the behaviour and running features. For example, in sleep mode the face and object detection is disabled.This can be configured to meet the requirements of any project.ConclusionThe software and behaviour is a topic that could be discussed at length, but I will leave that for another day. The above is a brief overview of the features and sensors that are available in the modular biped project."

    "content": "Disney Research has announced a new robot at IROS2023 that looks suspiciously like the BD-1 robot from Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order.This post from David Scaramuzza from the University of Zurich shows the robot in action.A more detailed article on IEEE Spectrum explains the research behind the robot and the technology used to create it.Disney’s history of animatronic characters dates back to 1971, with the Hall of Presidents at Disney World, but making robots express emotions while moving convincingly has become increasingly challenging. To address this, Disney Research developed a new system leveraging reinforcement learning. The team, led by Moritz Bächer from Disney Research in Zurich, created the robot using 3D printing and modular hardware, allowing for rapid design iterations. It features a four-degree-of-freedom head and five-degree-of-freedom legs with dynamic balancing.Disney’s approach involves collaboration between animators and roboticists, combining artistic intent with technical expertise. The challenge lies in translating animations into real-world robot movements effectively. Disney Research’s solution is a reinforcement learning-based pipeline that simulates and balances the animator’s vision with robust robotic actions. This system significantly reduces the time required to develop a new robotic character from years to months.Reinforcement learning also leads to highly robust motions, enabling the robot to adapt to real-world scenarios while maintaining its character.The researchers emphasize that the key takeaway is not just the robot itself but the adaptable process. This platform is hardware-agnostic, allowing for the rapid development of new behaviors, even with different robot forms. Disney aims to explore physical robotic characters further in future.It’s great to see this kind of research being done in the field of robotics, and I’m excited to see what comes next."

    "content": "As a maker that loves to show my projects to the world, one of the challenges I have always faced is understanding the best platform to do that.Many years ago I worked in web development. It was, by comparison, much less accessible. I’m pleased to say that things have improved, now affordable and maintainable hosting solutions are everywhere.Enter GitHub Pages.What is GitHub Pages?  Not a fan of guides? Check out the TL;DR at the end.GitHub Pages is a free service that allows you to host a static website for free. It’s a great way to get started with a website and to get your projects out there. And best of all, you don’t need to know anything about web development to get started.GitHub Pages allows you to create static pages using Markdown, a simple markup language that is easy to learn. You can also use HTML if you prefer. GitHub Pages also supports Jekyll, a static site generator that allows you to create dynamic websites using Markdown and Liquid templates. Don’t worry if you don’t know these terms yet. We’ll get there!What about custom domains?By default you’d access your website from the URL username.github.io, but GitHub Pages also allows you to use a custom domain name. This means that you can have a website with your own domain name, like mydomainname.com. This is a great way to make your website look more professional and to make it easier for people to find you.If you’d like to explore this option now, you can find more information here.How do I get started?You’ll need to familiarise yourself with a few things to get this working. Don’t worry, it’s not as complicated as it sounds. I’ll walk you through the process step by step.  Take your time if you’re not familiar with these concepts. Understanding each step is important and will help you feel more confident in working with these tools.If you’re not familiar with using the command line (or terminal), you might want to take a look at a basic tutorial. That said, there is an app called GitHub Desktop that allows you to do most of this without using the command line, but I won’t be covering that here. I’ll leave it up to you to decide which you prefer.Install JekyllJekyll is a static site generator that allows you to create dynamic websites using Markdown and Liquid templates. It’s a great way to get started with a website and to get your projects out there. And best of all, you don’t need to know anything about web development to get started.Install JekyllCreate a GitHub accountThe first thing you need to do is create a GitHub account. If you don’t already have one, you can sign up for free at GitHub.com.Next you’ll need to set up git on your computer: Set up gitCreate a new repository from a themeWhat are repositories?Once you have an account, you can create a new repository. A repository is simply a location on your GitHub account where you will store your website files. It comes with some really nice features that let you track and manage changes and even let other people contribute.The naming of your repository must be username.github.io where username is your GitHub username. For example, if my GitHub username is makerforge so my repository name is makerforge.github.io. (Note: You can also set up organisations in github, but that’s a topic for another day.)Finding a themeGitHub pages supports a number of themes. These are pre-existing layouts that allow you to create a website without having to worry about the design. You can find a list of themes here. You can also create your own theme if you want to. As an example, this website uses the Chirpy theme. It comes with example pages and even the source code for the theme itself.If you want to use a theme, there are often starter repos that you can copy (fork) to your own account. This is a great way to get started quickly. If you’d like to use a theme, fork the repo and name it username.github.io where username is your GitHub username. You can then edit the files to customise your website.How to Fork a repositoryCreate your websiteNow you have a repository, you can start creating your website. You can do this in a number of ways. You can create a website using HTML, Markdown, or Jekyll. If you’re not sure which one to use, I’d recommend starting with Markdown. It’s easy to learn and you can always switch to HTML or Jekyll later if you want to.Get a local copy of your repositoryAt the moment your repository and all the files are stored on GitHub’s servers. You can edit them online directly, but I’d recommend getting a local copy of your repository. This will allow you to edit your files on your computer and then upload them to GitHub when you’re ready.How to Clone a repository locallyStart making changesNow you have a local copy of your repository, you can start making changes. If you’re using Markdown, you can edit your files using any text editor. If you’re using HTML, you can use any HTML editor. If you’re using Jekyll, you can use any text editor or IDE that supports Jekyll. I’d recommend using Visual Studio Code as it has great support for Markdown and Jekyll.You will see a list of files and folders (directories). Fortunately You can ignore most of these.The areas you’re interested in are:  _posts - This is where your blog posts will go. You can create a new file for each post. The file name should be in the format YYYY-MM-DD-title.md where YYYY-MM-DD is the date of your post and title is the title of your post. For example, 2023-10-04-github-pages.md. You can use Markdown or HTML for your posts.  _pages - This is where your pages will go. You can create a new file for each page. The file name should be in the format title.md where title is the title of your page. For example, about.md. You can use Markdown or HTML for your pages.  _tabs - This is where your tabs will go. You can create a new file for each tab. The file name should be in the format title.md where title is the title of your tab. For example, about.md. You can use Markdown or HTML for your tabs.  _config.yml - This is where you can configure your website. You can change the title, description, and other settings here. You can also change the theme here.  assets - This is where you can store images and other files that you want to use on your website. You can create subfolders to organise your files.The home page in the theme above is a list of the posts, so you’ll need to create at least one post to see anything on your website.Commit your changesTry this out by creating a post, once you’ve done that, you can commit your changes. This will save your changes to your local repository. You can then push your changes to GitHub. This will upload your changes to GitHub and make them available on your website.How to Commit and Push changesView your websiteYou can build your website locally by running bundle exec jekyll serve from the command line. This will build your website and make it available at http://localhost:4000. You can then view your website in your browser at that address.You should see the changes you have made. If you don’t, check the output from the command line to see if there are any errors.Installing Google Analytics and AdsenseIf you’re like me and want to know whether people are actually viewing your content, you can use Google Analytics to track visits to your site easily. Simply sign up for an account and then add the tracking identifier (G-XXXXXXXX) to the _config.yml file in your repository (next to id: under google_analytics:).For google adsense, it’s a little more complicated:  Create an adsense account, add your site and copy the code required (It should look something like this &lt;script data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-XXXXX\" async src=\"https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;).  Customise your adsense configuration to allow ‘auto ads’. This will place ads on your site automatically where they are most likely to be seen.  Create a folder _includes in your repository, then create an empty file head.html. If this already exists you can skip the next step.  Navigate to the theme repo and copy the content of the file head.html into your new file (example)  In that file, before the line that reads &lt;/head&gt; add the code copied from Google Adsense.What next?Now you have a website, you can start adding content. You can create new posts, pages, and tabs. You can also customise the theme and add your own images and files. To deploy the latest changes simply commit and push your changes to GitHub. The in-built github action will take care of the rest.ConclusionThis is a very basic introduction to GitHub Pages. There is a lot more you can do with it, but hopefully this will get you started. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the community. I’d also love to see what you create, so please share your website with us!If you’d like to see a video explaining this process, take a look at this video by Techno Tim.TD;LR?Just want to get on with it?Assuming you have jekyll, git and github already configured, you can fork the repo then use these terminal commands to get your own website up and running in your own github pages repository.Sign in to GitHub and browse to Chirpy Starter, click the button Use this template &gt; Create a new repository, and name the new repository username.github.io, where username represents your GitHub username.On your local computer:# Clone the theme repositorygit clone &lt;your new repository url&gt;# Change directory to your repositorycd &lt;your new repository&gt;# Install the dependenciesbundle# Run local serverbundle exec jekyll serve# Navigate to http://localhost:4000 in your web browser"
