    "content": "As a project to keep myself sane during the COVID lockdowns, I began looking into making a companion robot using Raspberry Pi, Arduino and 3D printing as a study in how to build a desktop companion robot. I wanted to make something that was fully autonomous and responded to the presense and interaction of people in the room. It also needed to be reasonably affordable (as much as robotics can be!) and accessible.The project has evolved over the last few years and a community has begun to grow around it. This led to a number of changes to allow the platform to be more modular, allowing any number of robots to be created using the software with reuse of any relevant hardware components and modules.OverviewThe Modular Biped Robot project is designed to provide a flexible and modular framework for robotics development using Python and C++ on the Raspberry Pi and Arduino platforms. It aims to enable developers, robotics enthusiasts, and curious individuals to experiment, create, and customize their own biped robots. With a range of features and functionalities and the option to add your own easily, the Modular Biped Robot Project offers an exciting opportunity to explore the world of robotics.ModularityThe project is designed to be modular, meaning any components that are not required for the implementation can be removed and the functionality can be disabled by removing the initialisation in the main.py python file. Similarly, new modules can be integrated as easily by following the guide below.ModulesCreating a ModuleVersioningThere have been 3 versions of this project, version 2 was the smaller and less stable build detailed in the playlist below.Watch the introduction on YouTubeCompanion Robot v2 PlaylistThe current development is ongoing on version 3. This documentation is exclusively for version 3.PlatformsAlthough the project was built on the Raspberry Pi 3B+ and Arduino Pro Mini, community members are working on the integration of other platforms such as the Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi 4 &amp; 5, Arduin Nano and the DFRobot UniHiker SBC.We plan on sharing any relevant files to support these platforms so feel free to join the community and share your experience / requirments.Contributions and DiscussionsWe encourage active participation, contributions, and discussions from the Modular Biped Robot community. If you have any questions, ideas, suggestions, or would like to share your experiences, you can join our GitHub Discussions section dedicated to the project. It’s a great place to engage with other community members, exchange knowledge, and collaborate on the development of biped robotics.Read more here: CommunityWe look forward to your participation and the exciting advancements we can achieve together in the field of modular biped robots!Get StartedThe wiki and files are available on the GitHub repository linked below:Modular Biped WikiRepositoryDiscussions"

    "content": "As a maker that loves to show my projects to the world, one of the challenges I have always faced is understanding the best platform to do that.Many years ago I worked in web development. It was, by comparison, much less accessible. I’m pleased to say that things have improved, now affordable and maintainable hosting solutions are everywhere.Enter GitHub Pages.What is GitHub Pages?  Not a fan of guides? Check out the TL;DR at the end.GitHub Pages is a free service that allows you to host a static website for free. It’s a great way to get started with a website and to get your projects out there. And best of all, you don’t need to know anything about web development to get started.GitHub Pages allows you to create static pages using Markdown, a simple markup language that is easy to learn. You can also use HTML if you prefer. GitHub Pages also supports Jekyll, a static site generator that allows you to create dynamic websites using Markdown and Liquid templates. Don’t worry if you don’t know these terms yet. We’ll get there!What about custom domains?By default you’d access your website from the URL username.github.io, but GitHub Pages also allows you to use a custom domain name. This means that you can have a website with your own domain name, like mydomainname.com. This is a great way to make your website look more professional and to make it easier for people to find you.If you’d like to explore this option now, you can find more information here.How do I get started?You’ll need to familiarise yourself with a few things to get this working. Don’t worry, it’s not as complicated as it sounds. I’ll walk you through the process step by step.  Take your time if you’re not familiar with these concepts. Understanding each step is important and will help you feel more confident in working with these tools.If you’re not familiar with using the command line (or terminal), you might want to take a look at a basic tutorial. That said, there is an app called GitHub Desktop that allows you to do most of this without using the command line, but I won’t be covering that here. I’ll leave it up to you to decide which you prefer.Create a GitHub accountThe first thing you need to do is create a GitHub account. If you don’t already have one, you can sign up for free at GitHub.com.Next you’ll need to set up git on your computer: Set up gitCreate a new repository from a themeWhat are repositories?Once you have an account, you can create a new repository. A repository is simply a location on your GitHub account where you will store your website files. It comes with some really nice features that let you track and manage changes and even let other people contribute.The naming of your repository must be username.github.io where username is your GitHub username. For example, if my GitHub username is makerforge so my repository name is makerforge.github.io. (Note: You can also set up organisations in github, but that’s a topic for another day.)Finding a themeGitHub pages supports a number of themes. These are pre-existing layouts that allow you to create a website without having to worry about the design. You can find a list of themes here. You can also create your own theme if you want to. As an example, this website uses the Chirpy theme. It comes with example pages and even the source code for the theme itself.If you want to use a theme, there are often starter repos that you can copy (fork) to your own account. This is a great way to get started quickly. If you’d like to use a theme, fork the repo and name it username.github.io where username is your GitHub username. You can then edit the files to customise your website.How to Fork a repositoryCreate your websiteNow you have a repository, you can start creating your website. You can do this in a number of ways. You can create a website using HTML, Markdown, or Jekyll. If you’re not sure which one to use, I’d recommend starting with Markdown. It’s easy to learn and you can always switch to HTML or Jekyll later if you want to.Get a local copy of your repositoryAt the moment your repository and all the files are stored on GitHub’s servers. You can edit them online directly, but I’d recommend getting a local copy of your repository. This will allow you to edit your files on your computer and then upload them to GitHub when you’re ready.How to Clone a repository locallyStart making changesNow you have a local copy of your repository, you can start making changes. If you’re using Markdown, you can edit your files using any text editor. If you’re using HTML, you can use any HTML editor. If you’re using Jekyll, you can use any text editor or IDE that supports Jekyll. I’d recommend using Visual Studio Code as it has great support for Markdown and Jekyll.You will see a list of files and folders (directories). Fortunately You can ignore most of these.The areas you’re interested in are:  _posts - This is where your blog posts will go. You can create a new file for each post. The file name should be in the format YYYY-MM-DD-title.md where YYYY-MM-DD is the date of your post and title is the title of your post. For example, 2023-10-04-github-pages.md. You can use Markdown or HTML for your posts.  _pages - This is where your pages will go. You can create a new file for each page. The file name should be in the format title.md where title is the title of your page. For example, about.md. You can use Markdown or HTML for your pages.  _tabs - This is where your tabs will go. You can create a new file for each tab. The file name should be in the format title.md where title is the title of your tab. For example, about.md. You can use Markdown or HTML for your tabs.  _config.yml - This is where you can configure your website. You can change the title, description, and other settings here. You can also change the theme here.  assets - This is where you can store images and other files that you want to use on your website. You can create subfolders to organise your files.The home page in the theme above is a list of the posts, so you’ll need to create at least one post to see anything on your website.Commit your changesTry this out by creating a post, once you’ve done that, you can commit your changes. This will save your changes to your local repository. You can then push your changes to GitHub. This will upload your changes to GitHub and make them available on your website.How to Commit and Push changesView your websiteYou can build your website locally by running bundle exec jekyll serve from the command line. This will build your website and make it available at http://localhost:4000. You can then view your website in your browser at that address.You should see the changes you have made. If you don’t, check the output from the command line to see if there are any errors.What next?Now you have a website, you can start adding content. You can create new posts, pages, and tabs. You can also customise the theme and add your own images and files. To deploy the latest changes simply commit and push your changes to GitHub. The in-built github action will take care of the rest.ConclusionThis is a very basic introduction to GitHub Pages. There is a lot more you can do with it, but hopefully this will get you started. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the community. I’d also love to see what you create, so please share your website with us!If you’d like to see a video explaining this process, take a look at this video by Techno Tim.TD;LR?Just want to get on with it?Assuming you have git and github already configured, you can fork the repo then use these terminal commands to get your own website up and running in your own github pages repository.Sign in to GitHub and browse to Chirpy Starter, click the button Use this template &gt; Create a new repository, and name the new repository username.github.io, where username represents your GitHub username.On your local computer:# Clone the theme repositorygit clone &lt;your new repository url&gt;# Change directory to your repositorycd &lt;your new repository&gt;# Install the dependenciesbundle# Run local serverbundle exec jekyll serve# Navigate to http://localhost:4000 in your web browser"
