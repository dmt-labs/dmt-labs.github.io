      Emir Hamurcu is a 17 year old maker from Turkey who has been working on a bipedal robot using the Modular Robotics Framework. He very kindly allowed me to interview him about his project and his journey into robotics.

Can you introduce yourself and share a bit about your background and how you got into robotics and making?

      Many makers use software or 3D models as part of their projects and need a safe way to store those files and share them with others. Git is a great tool for this and is used by many makers and developers around the world. Let’s take a look at how the basics

      Following on from my recent post discussing examples of walking robots, it became clear that a logical next step would be to look at how we can teach a robot to walk using simulators and reinforcement learning.

Let’s take a look at these concepts and how they can be applied to the Modular Biped project.

      The biggest question I get asked when showing my bipedal robot to people is is “Does it walk?”.

The answer is ‘no’, or rather, ‘not yet’.

In order to understand the problem, we need to understand the basics of walking robots and the challenges that they face. This post will talk about a few examples available today.

      The Raspberry Pi 5 was announced last month and offers a number of improvements over the model currently used in the Modular Robotics Bipedal Robot project (The Pi 3B+). Let’s do a comparison to see what kind of features and issues we’d expect to see when using the new model.
