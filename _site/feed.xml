      Featured on Official Raspberry Pi News

I was very excited to see that the Modular Biped project was featured on the official Raspberry Pi news page. This is a great honour and I’m very grateful to the Raspberry Pi team for the recognition. The article focussed on the background of the project and the history of the development.

      When I first started working on the modular biped project, I had a few features in mind. The way that the robot behaved would depend entirely on the sensors and actuators it had in it’s arsenal. For that reason (and because I enjoy trying new things!) I decided to add as many as reasonably possible, as long as they were relevant to the brief of a ‘desktop companion robot’.

      Disney Research has announced a new robot at IROS2023 that looks suspiciously like the BD-1 robot from Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order.

This post from David Scaramuzza from the University of Zurich shows the robot in action.



A more detailed article on IEEE Spectrum explains the research behind the robot and the technology used to create it.

      As a maker that loves to show my projects to the world, one of the challenges I have always faced is understanding the best platform to do that.

Many years ago I worked in web development. It was, by comparison, much less accessible. I’m pleased to say that things have improved, now affordable and maintainable hosting solutions are everywhere.

Enter GitHub Pages.

What is GitHub Pages?

      Since the creation of version 3 of the modular robotics framework, this video covers an overview of the project and the history of each version.

The project has evolved over the last few years and a community has begun to grow around it. This led to a number of changes to allow the platform to be more modular, allowing any number of robots to be created using the software with reuse of any rel...
