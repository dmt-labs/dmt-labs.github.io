      Following on from my recent post discussing examples of walking robots, it became clear that a logical next step would be to look at how we can teach a robot to walk using simulators and reinforcement learning.

Let’s take a look at these concepts and how they can be applied to the Modular Biped project.

What is a simulator?

A simulator is a piece of software that allows us to create a virtua...

      The biggest question I get asked when showing my bipedal robot to people is is “Does it walk?”.

The answer is ‘no’, or rather, ‘not yet’.

In order to understand the problem, we need to understand the basics of walking robots and the challenges that they face. This post will talk about a few examples available today.

      The Raspberry Pi 5 was announced last month and offers a number of improvements over the model currently used in the Modular Robotics Bipedal Robot project (The Pi 3B+). Let’s do a comparison to see what kind of features and issues we’d expect to see when using the new model.

      Earlier in the year I was invited to speak about the Modular Robotics Framework on session 2 of the Reddit Robotics Showcase. This was a great opportunity to share the project with a wider audience and to talk about the history of the project and the future plans.

The playlist for the entire showcase is now available on YouTube and linked below. There were a lot of really interesting projects,...

      Featured on Official Raspberry Pi News

I was very excited to see that the Modular Biped project was featured on the official Raspberry Pi news page. This is a great honour and I’m very grateful to the Raspberry Pi team for the recognition. The article focussed on the background of the project and the history of the development.
