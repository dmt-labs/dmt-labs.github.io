      If you’re looking for a laptop that’s easy to upgrade and customize, look no further than the Framework Laptop. This laptop is designed to be modular, which means you can easily swap out components like the battery, storage, and even the ports.

One of the coolest things about the Framework Laptop is that you can create your own custom modules to add new functionality to the laptop. In this pos...

      Many makers use software or 3D models as part of their projects and need a safe way to store those files and share them with others. Git is a great tool for this and is used by many makers and developers around the world. Let’s take a look at how the basics

      Following on from my recent post discussing examples of walking robots, it became clear that a logical next step would be to look at how we can teach a robot to walk using simulators and reinforcement learning.

Let’s take a look at these concepts and how they can be applied to the Modular Biped project.

      The biggest question I get asked when showing my bipedal robot to people is is “Does it walk?”.

The answer is ‘no’, or rather, ‘not yet’.

In order to understand the problem, we need to understand the basics of walking robots and the challenges that they face. This post will talk about a few examples available today.

      The Raspberry Pi 5 was announced last month and offers a number of improvements over the model currently used in the Modular Robotics Bipedal Robot project (The Pi 3B+). Let’s do a comparison to see what kind of features and issues we’d expect to see when using the new model.
