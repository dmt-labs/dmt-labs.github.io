The Raspberry Pi 5 was announced last month and offers a number of improvements over the model currently used in the Modular Robotics Bipedal Robot project (The Pi 3B+). Let’s do a comparison to see what kind of features and issues we’d expect to see when using the new model.

      Earlier in the year I was invited to speak about the Modular Robotics Framework on session 2 of the Reddit Robotics Showcase. This was a great opportunity to share the project with a wider audience and to talk about the history of the project and the future plans.

The playlist for the entire showcase is now available on YouTube and linked below. There were a lot of really interesting projects,...

      Featured on Official Raspberry Pi News

I was very excited to see that the Modular Biped project was featured on the official Raspberry Pi news page. This is a great honour and I’m very grateful to the Raspberry Pi team for the recognition. The article focussed on the background of the project and the history of the development.

      When I first started working on the modular biped project, I had a few features in mind. The way that the robot behaved would depend entirely on the sensors and actuators it had in it’s arsenal. For that reason (and because I enjoy trying new things!) I decided to add as many as reasonably possible, as long as they were relevant to the brief of a ‘desktop companion robot’.

      Disney Research has announced a new robot at IROS2023 that looks suspiciously like the BD-1 robot from Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order.

This post from David Scaramuzza from the University of Zurich shows the robot in action.



A more detailed article on IEEE Spectrum explains the research behind the robot and the technology used to create it.
