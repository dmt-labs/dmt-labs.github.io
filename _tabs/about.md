A friend from the maker community suggested that I start a blog to document my projects and share my experiences. I thought it was a great idea, so here we are!

This website will cover information about the various builds I have been working on and will include guides, tutorials, and other resources to help you get started with your own projects.

The main project is the [Modular Robotics Framework](/modular-biped/) (which is probably why you're here), but this platform also gives me the opportunity to share other projects and ideas that I have been working on as well as work from other makers in the community.

I hope you enjoy the content and find it useful. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to get in touch.
