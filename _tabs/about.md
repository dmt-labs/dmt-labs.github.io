Welcome to MakerForge.tech! This is a platform where I share projects, ideas, and guides in the world of robotics, electronics and DIY innovation.

The mission of Maker Forge is to inspire and empower makers, hobbyists, and enthusiasts to explore the world of open-source robotics, electronics & 3D printing. Whether you're a seasoned pro or just starting out, the projects and resources here are designed to help you unleash your creativity and bring your ideas to life.

The main project is the award winning [Modular Robotics Framework](/modular-biped/) which is a biped robot built on an versatile and accessible platform for building robots of all shapes and sizes. This framework is open-source and 3D printable, making it easy for anyone to get started with robotics.

I hope you enjoy the content and find it useful. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to get in touch.
